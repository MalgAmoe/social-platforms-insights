<h3 id="naming-patterns-for-metrics">Naming Patterns for Metrics</h3>
<p>The _unique suffix indicates that this metric shows the number of unique users who performed a specific action. Metrics generated with the _unique suffix are approximate and may not be 100% accurate.</p>
<p>The _login and _logout suffixes indicate whether someone was logged into or out of Facebook.</p>
<p>The _source suffix indicates that the metric will be broken down into a list of referral sources. External referrals are broken down by domain. Internal referrals are broken down by Facebook-specific features such as ‘Profile’, ‘Search’, ‘Requests’, ‘Suggestions’, ‘Stream’, etc. In these case the value returned will be an object containing a series of key-value pairs where the key is the source name and the value is the metric for that source.</p>
<p>Most metrics will update once every 24 hours. Some metrics, marked with an *, are refreshed several times during the day.</p>
