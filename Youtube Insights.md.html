<p>Youtube insights are not served with specific calls, you have to generate queries to get the data you are interested in.<br>
The data is caracterised by metrics(the measurement like views, likes and dislikes) and dimensions(the criteria to aggregate data, like country or date).<br>
You can then specify filters to have a limited set of answers.</p>

<h3 id="audience-retention-metrics">Audience retention metrics</h3>
<h5 id="audience_retention_percentage">audience_retention_percentage</h5>
<p>The absolute ratio of viewers watching the video at the given point in the video. The ratio is calculated by comparing the number of times a portion of a video has been watched to the total number of views of the video. The elapsed_video_time_percentage dimension identifies the portion of the video to which the metric corresponds.</p>
<p>Note that a portion of a video could be watched more than once (or not at all) in a given video view. For example, if users rewind and watch the same portion of a video multiple times, then the absolute ratio for that portion of the video the could be greater than 1.</p>
<p>The following examples illustrate how the value is calculated:</p>
<ul>
<li>A one-minute video is watched 100 times. Half of the viewers stop watching after 15 seconds and the rest watch the entire video. None of the viewers watch any parts of the video more than once. In this case, this metric’s value would be 1 for time buckets in the first quarter of the video, and its value would be 0.50 for the remainder of the video.</li>
<li>A one-minute video is watched 100 times. All of the viewers watch the entire video, but 20 of the viewers watch until the video’s 45-second mark, then skip back to the video’s 30-second mark, and then watch the remainder of the video. In this case, the metric’s value would be 1 for time buckets in either the first half or the last quarter of the video. However, the value would be 1.2 for time buckets in the third quarter of the video since 100 percent of the viewers watched that segment of the video but 20% of those viewers watched the segment twice.</li>
</ul>

<p>This dimension identifies the gender of the logged-in users associated with the report data. Valid values are FEMALE, MALE, and GENDER_OTHER.</p>
<p>Note that the YouTube Analytics API currently only returns the values female and male. As such, you may see some discrepancy in the views_percentage metric values that the two APIs return. (In the YouTube Analytics API, views_percentage is called viewerPercentage.)</p>
